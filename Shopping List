Recommended Materials
o	Breadboard – for creating temporary circuits without soldering.
o	Soldering iron and solder – for permanent connections.
o	Jumper wires – to connect different components on the breadboard.
o	Screwdriver set – for assembling and securing components.
o	Electrical tape – to insulate exposed wires or connections.
o	Cutting tools (e.g., wire cutters, scissors) – for trimming wires and materials.
